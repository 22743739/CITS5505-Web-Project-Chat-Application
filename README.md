# CITS5505-Web-Project-Chat-Application
I am a student from the University of Western Australia. My name is Yulin Yu(22743739). In this project, I need to build a text-based chat application together with my other team member Wendy Wang(23454213).

Firstly, we built the basic framework of the chat application. We created the homoe page, login page, registration page and search page. Then the user table was added, and the login/registration interface was developed.Then we let the front end register.html support form validation. Next, we complete the login and registration functions. We updated api_key for openai and then connected to chatGPT.
