# CITS5505-Web-Project-Chat-Application
I am a student from the University of Western Australia. My name is Yulin Yu(22743739). In this project, I need to build a text-based chat application together with my other team member Wendy Wang(23454213).

Firstly, we built the basic framework of the chat application. We created the homoe page, login page, registration page and search page. Then initialize Flask and SQLite, add user tables, chat message tables, develop login/registration functions, and support form verification, users can register their own accounts to join in the chat. The real-time chat is developed based on WebSocket. All users can join the public chat room, chat one-on-one privately, and have Q&A with openAI's chatGPT. All chat records will be stored in SQLite, and the historical chat records will be loaded every time a chat is opened. Users can also search for historical chat records based on keywords on the search page.
